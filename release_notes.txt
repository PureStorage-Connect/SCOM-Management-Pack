NEW FEATURES
Bulk overrides of SCOM overridable configuration parameters are now possible. This script will allow for the bulk changing of thresholds in Rules, Monitors, and Discoveries.

FIXES
Corrected the Pure Storage SCOM support link visible in the alerts.
Corrected a metric unit issue in the Bandwidth and IOPS monitor and rule.
Increased the default threshold value of the Bandwidth and IOPS monitor.
Corrected a contradictory alert message in the Bandwidth and IOPS monitor. If the bandwidth/ IOPS exceeds the set threshold, an alert will be raised.

INSTALLATION AND UNINSTALLATION
To install the Management Pack, extract and run SCOMManagementPackInstaller.msi, and follow the instructions.
